# Welcome!

Welcome to my profile, here you'll find trinkets, odds and ends, that sort of thing!

I do mostly development of small tools and some _R&D_, mostly with C (and variants)
and Python, on top of Linux.

Feel free to look around!

Here are some of my latest and relevant projects and contributions:

- [LitaC](https://github.com/Wiguwbe/litac-lang)  
This is forked from [Tony Sparks](https://github.com/tonysparks) and I just **love** this project,
it is pretty much everything I've been looking for in terms of improvements to the C language.  
It uses a syntax similar to Golang, but compiles to C!  
I implemented a feature or two mainly focusing on the integration
of LitaC in C projects.

- [BetterC containers](https://github.com/Wiguwbe/betterc-containers)  
Before venturing further into LitaC, I tried Dlang with the `-betterC` switch.  
It was pretty good, but I had some troubles as the language itself
is still very attached to the "normal" way.  
Anyway, in those adventures I ended up creating some generic containers. Someone may find this useful.

- [You're the OS](https://github.com/Wiguwbe/youre-the-os)  
Forked from [Pier-Luc Brault](https://github.com/plbrault), this is a game where you're the OS scheduler! Do read more on the main repo.  
In this, I implemented a way to "automate" the game using a script. I haven't been contributing much to it so I don't know the
current state of it. This is here mostly as a memo.

- [ChibiCC](https://github.com/Wiguwbe/chibicc)  
This is a C compiler developed by [Rui Ueyama](https://github.com/rui314), do read more about it on the main repo.  
In my fork, I use it mostly for "showcasing" some features that _could_ be interesting, mainly
found on higher level languages that are implemented solely
on the compiler.  
I implement these features in separate branches, so feel free to explore them!

- [bash JSON](https://github.com/Wiguwbe/bash-json)  
This is a collection of bash builtins to handle JSON directly from the terminal (bash).  
It was a nice _R&D_ project and I'm yet to add examples ...
